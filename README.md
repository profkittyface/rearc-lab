### Q. What do I have to submit?
1. Your work assets, as one or both of the following:
  - A link to a hosted git repository.
  - A ZIP file containing your project directory. Include the `.git` sub-directory if you used git.
2. Proof of completion, as one or both of the following:
  - Link(s) to hosted public cloud deployment(s).
  - One or more screenshots showing, at least, the index page of the final deployment in one or more public cloud(s) you have chosen.
3. An answer to the prompt: "Given more time, I would improve..."
  - Discuss any shortcomings/immaturities in your solution and the reasons behind them (lack of time is a perfectly fine reason!)
  - **This may carry as much weight as the code itself**

Your work assets should include:

- IaC files, if you completed that task.
- One or more Dockerfiles, if you completed that task.
- A sensible README or other file(s) that contain instructions, notes, or other written documentation to help us review and assess your submission.
